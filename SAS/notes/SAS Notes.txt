## Lesson 1;

Majority of SAS statements are Data or Proc
Global Statements (Libname, title, options) do not need to be followed by run;

File Path for exercises: S:/workshop/EPG1V2/data

To comment out a single statement with a semi colon at the end you can use *
/* */ is used for a whole line

Highlight text and use ctrl / to comment a line


## Lesson 2 - Accessing Data;

Data is generally structured or unstructured

SAS tables, Access or Excel tables

Unstructured data - no defined columns - examples include text, delimited, JSON, weblogs

Must be imported into SAS

SAS tables have extension .sas7bdat

Descriptor portion of SAS table contains metadata

Column must have 3 attributes - name, type and length

1-32 characters
must start with letter or underscore
can be mixed case

Numeric - contains digits 0-9, minus sign, decimal point or scientific notation only.

SAS Dates - number of days between 01Jan1960.

Numeric columns are 8 bytes 
Character codes are 1-32767 bytes

Missing character values are represented as "" (empty space)

Missing numeric values are represented as . (full stop)

Proc contents step allows you to see the descriptor of a table

Create a SAS library:

LIBNAME libref engine "path";

Libref is 8 characters max, must start with letter or underscore and continues with letters, numbers or underscores

Engine is set of instructions - base for SAS tables 

"path" is location. 

Example statement:

LIBNAME mylib base "s:/workshop/data";

Libname statements remain active until it is deleted or the sas session is ended.

Work library is temporary library - contents deleted at the end of the session.

SASHELP is also defined - includes sample data

When importing Excel data you can specify options validvarname=v7; This forces non-SAS compatible column names into appropriate formats


PROC IMPORT DATAFILE="path/filename" DBMS=filetype
OUT=output-table;
RUN;

PROC IMPORT reads data from a non-sas table. DBMS = defines the delimiter type.

## Lesson 3: Exploring and Validating Data

Proc Contents allows you to explore the data

Proc print - creates list of all rows and columns

Proc means - simple summary stats, can see missing values

Proc univariate - more detailed stats of distribution

Proc freq - frequency distribution


When using conditional where statement - dates must be written like

"ddmmmyyyy"d 

Missing numeric values are treated as 0 in conditional where statements

is missing + is not missing are two key words you can use to filter out missing values

between and like can also be used - % is a wildcard for any number of characters and _ is a single character


Macro Variables allows you to declare global macro

%let macro-variable = value;

Example:

%let carType = Wagon;

proc print data=sashelp.cars;
where type = "&carType";
run;

Macro variables are temporary

You can apply formats to SAS tables using:

Proc print data=input-table;
format col-names format;
run;

Does not change raw data values.

PROC Sort can be used to sort data - out= is needed
	by <descending> col-name;
run;

Proc sort doesn't output results - have to print the resulting tables

NODUPKEY keeps only the first instance of value occurring.

BY _ALL_; - removes all duplicates

dupout = view the duplicated rows removed by the nodupkey 


Summary of Lesson 3: Exploring and Validating Data
Exploring Data
PROC PRINT lists all columns and rows in the input table by default. The OBS= data set option limits the number of rows listed. The VAR statement limits and orders the columns listed.

PROC PRINT DATA=input-table(OBS=n);
        VAR col-name(s);
RUN;

PROC MEANS generates simple summary statistics for each numeric column in the input data by default. The VAR statement limits the variables to analyze.

PROC MEANS DATA=input-table;
        VAR col-name(s);
RUN;

PROC UNIVARIATE also generates summary statistics for each numeric column in the data by default, but includes more detailed statistics related to distribution and extreme values. The VAR statement limits the variables to analyze.

PROC UNIVARIATE DATA=input-table;
        VAR col-name(s);
RUN;

PROC FREQ creates a frequency table for each variable in the input table by default. You can limit the variables analyzed by using the TABLES statement.

PROC FREQ DATA=input-table;
        TABLES col-name(s) < / options>;
RUN;

Filtering Rows
The WHERE statement is used to filter rows. If the expression is true, rows are read. If the expression is false, they are not.

Character values are case sensitive and must be in quotation marks.

Numeric values are not in quotation marks and must only include digits, decimal points, and negative signs.

Compound conditions can be created with AND or OR.

The logic of an operator can be reversed with the NOT keyword.

When an expression includes a fixed date value, use the SAS date constant syntax: “ddmmmyyyy”d, where dd represents a 1- or 2-digit day, mmm represents a 3-letter month in any case, and yyyy represents a 2- or 4-digit year.

PROC procedure-name ... ;
        WHERE expression;
RUN;

WHERE Operators
= or EQ
^= or ~= or NE
> or GT
< or LT
>= or GE
<= or LE


SAS Date Constant
"ddMONyyyy"d


IN Operator
WHERE col-name IN(value-1<...,value-n>);
WHERE col-name NOT IN (value-1<…,value-n>);


Special WHERE Operators
WHERE col-name IS MISSING;
WHERE col-name IS NOT MISSING;
WHERE col-name IS NULL;
WHERE col-name BETWEEN value-1 AND value-2;
WHERE col-name LIKE "value";
WHERE col-name =* "value";


Filtering Rows with Macro Variables
%LET macro-variable=value;


Example WHERE Statements with Macro Variables:
WHERE numvar=&macrovar;
WHERE charvar="&macrovar";
WHERE datevar="&macrovar"d

A macro variable stores a text string that can be substituted into a SAS program.

The %LET statement defines the macro variable name and assigns a value.

Macro variable names must follow SAS naming rules.

Macro variables can be referenced in a program by preceding the macro variable name with an &.

If a macro variable reference is used inside quotation marks, double quotation marks must be used.
Formatting Columns
Formats are used to change the way values are displayed in data and reports.

Formats do not change the underlying data values.

Formats can be applied in a procedure using the FORMAT statement.

Visit SAS Language Elements documentation to access a list of available SAS formats.

PROC PRINT DATA=input-table;
        FORMAT col-name(s) format;
RUN;

<$>format-name<w>.<d>
Sorting Data and Removing Duplicates
PROC SORT sorts the rows in a table on one or more character or numeric columns.

The OUT= option specifies an output table. Without this option, PROC SORT changes the order of rows in the input table.

The BY statement specifies one or more columns in the input table whose values are used to sort the rows. By default, SAS sorts in ascending order.

PROC SORT DATA=input-table <OUT=output-table>;
        BY <DESCENDING> col-name(s);
RUN;


The NODUPKEY option keeps only the first row for each unique value of the column(s) listed in the BY statement.

The NODUPKEY option together with the BY _ALL_ statement removes adjacent rows that are entirely duplicated.

The DUPOUT= option creates an output table containing duplicates removed.

PROC SORT DATA=input-table <OUT=output-table>
                      NODUPKEY <DUPOUT=output-table>;
        BY _ALL_;
RUN;

PROC SORT DATA=input-table <OUT=output-table>
                      NODUPKEY <DUPOUT=output-table>;
        BY col-name(s);
RUN;
