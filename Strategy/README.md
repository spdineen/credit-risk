# Basic Principles of Credit Risk Strategy


The purpose of a Credit Risk Strategy is to:
    Ensure regulatory compliance with responsible and sustainable lending
    Mitigate credit losses.

Stages of the Credit Risk process:

Pre Approval:

Prior to initiating a full bureau assessment, certain criteria can be applied to eliminate the need for a bureau call:

Customers can be immediately declined if they don't meet criteria based on:

Age
Income
Residental status (Non-UK)
Employment type (Unemployed)

Provided a customer meets these initial cutoffs then their application can be passed through to a bureau.

Bureau data can be reused provided the timeframe of initial bureau data is not too far out of date.
