# Basic Principles of Credit Risk Strategy


The purpose of a Credit Risk Strategy is to:
    Ensure regulatory compliance with responsible and sustainable lending
    Mitigate credit losses.

Stages of the Credit Risk process:

Pre Approval:

Prior to initiating a full bureau assessment, certain criteria can be applied to eliminate the need for a bureau call:

Customers can be immediately declined if they don't meet criteria based on:

Age
Income
Residental status (Non-UK)
Employment type (Unemployed)

Provided a customer meets these initial cutoffs then their application can be passed through to a bureau.

Bureau data can be reused provided the timeframe of initial bureau data is not too far out of date.

It is important to collect and standardise the following details from the customers credit application:
Full Name
Current Address
Date of Birth

This is to allow the best possible chance of finding a match at the bureau level at a high confidence level. 

One potential way to mitigate issues is to ensure that addresses are formatted in the correct way - using a dropdown box or API plug in to allow the customer to pick their address from an option could be a way to reduce the number of no-hits at bureau level.

Adverse Credit Data:

Upon confirming the identity of the customer - an appropriate credit strategy should focus on understanding the customers creditworthiness. 

Customers have to go through an affordability assessment if there is a regulatory responsibility to do so.
